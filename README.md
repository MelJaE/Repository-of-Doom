    Identify the article that you used (with a link): 
    Text over image with CSS https://www.designlabthemes.com/text-over-image-with-css/
    
    Summarize what you learned from the article (1-2 paragraphs):

    There are different ways to place text over an image in html and css. This article taught me two new ways of placing text over an image. How to place on the image using linear gradiant to modify the image so the text is more readable, and how to hover text when the mouse hovers over the image.
    
    
    Review the article. (2-3 paragraphs) You will need to say more than just it was good or bad. Explain clearly what you liked or didnâ€™t like about the article and how easy or hard it was to learn from their tutorial: 

    I liked the article. It was brief and to the point. The instructions were clear, and it was easy to gather the information needed to create an example of the code in the article. 
    I think the article could be improved by having a few more examples/options. It left me wondering what else I could do with images and text.
